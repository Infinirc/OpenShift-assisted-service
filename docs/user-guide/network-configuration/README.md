# Network Congfiguration

This document provides an overview of network configurations supported when deploying OCP using Assisted Service.

*Note*: Documentation referring directly to the REST API and SaaS has been moved to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/assembly_network-configuration. In here we only keep samples of Kube API usage.
